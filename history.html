    <p>This year, as the vibrant beats of the dhak echo through our hearts, we are not just celebrating Durga Puja; we are celebrating a golden milestoneâ€”fifty years of our shared history, faith, and community.</p>
    <p>Our story began in 1976. It was a humble seed of devotion planted together in the sacred premises of the Sani Mandir. Those early years were filled with an intimate spirit, where each and every one of us came together to bring Ma Durga into our lives. The bonds we forged in that small space laid the foundation for everything that was to come. As our community grew, so did our dreams. Our collective love for the Puja blossomed, and the time came for all of us to find a new home. The shift from the Sani Mandir to our current location marked a new chapter in our journey. It was a testament to the unwavering dedication and shared effort of every single member, creating a space that we all proudly call our own.</p>
    <p>This 50th year is more than just a date on a calendar. It is a celebration of every hand that has ever helped build the pandal, every voice that has sung a prayer, and every heart that has found joy and solace in the divine presence of the Goddess. We honour our past, celebrate our present, and look forward to a future filled with Ma Durga's eternal blessings.</p>

    <p>Join us as we commemorate this Golden Jubilee, a beautiful tapestry woven with fifty years of shared memories.</p>
